        <h2>Top 3 Favorite Movies</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
                <p>Not only is this my favorite Batman movie, this is easily one of the greatest movies I have ever watched.</p>
                <p>This move has intensity, drama, action, and many great themes to learn. Christian Bale and Heath Ledger play off of each other beautifully.</p>
                <p>The movie has my favorite villain, Joker, and Harvey Dent delivers the best line in cinema, "You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain"</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>The Greatest Showman</h3> 
                <p>While P.T. Barnam was a problematic guy, Hugh Jackman does a beautiful job portraying him in this movie. This movie made me love musicals</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
                <p>Pulp Fiction is a groundbreaking film that defies genre conventions with its nonlinear narrative and eclectic characters. Quentin Tarantino's direction and the ensemble cast deliver an unforgettable cinematic experience.</p>
