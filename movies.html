        <h2>Top 3 Favorite Movies</h2>

                <h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
                <p>Not only is this my favorite Batman movie, this is easily one of the greatest movies I have ever watched.
                This move has intensity, drama, action, and many great themes to learn. Christian Bale and Heath Ledger play off of each other beautifully.
                <p>The movie has my favorite villain, Joker, and Harvey Dent delivers the best line in cinema, "You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain". I can remember most of the movie at a second's notice, and every superhero who is supposed to be brooding or dark has definitely used this film as inspiration.
                    <p>There are many times I wish that I could rewatch this movie for the first time. There are so many different things you can miss even on a twentieth rewatch. Easily the best Batman of my lifetime is Christian Bale.

                <h3>The Greatest Showman</h3> 
                <p>While P.T. Barnam was a problematic guy, Hugh Jackman does a beautiful job portraying him in this movie. This movie made me love musicals. I was not expecting to like this movie too much, but I found myself getting highly invested in it and not wanting it to end. Zac Efron and Hugh Jackman provide the best scene in the movie, and the entire soundtrack is great song after great song. I still listen to it to this day.
                    <p>I watched this movie in a relatively crowded theatre, and the entire room was in awe over what they were seeing, feeling, and hearing. It was just a movie crafted by hardworking people and it came out near perfect.

                <h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
                <p>Pulp Fiction is a groundbreaking film that defies genre conventions with its nonlinear narrative and eclectic characters. Quentin Tarantino's direction and the ensemble cast deliver an unforgettable cinematic experience. From Bruce Willis to John Travolta to Uma Thurman to Samuel L Jackson, every actor gave an all-time performance. The story is told non-linearly which was very uncommon for its time. The characters were not typical bad vs evil, but instead they felt like actual humans with bad character traits or some good ones. The film is extremely violent, however it is not gratuitous. It is part of the story being told. </p>
