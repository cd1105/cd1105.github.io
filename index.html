        <p>Hi there! My name is <i><strong>Chris Dach</strong></i> who is 
            about to graduate from <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/">UW Madison</a> this spring! It has been a long but memorable time. However, this website is about the things I am most passionate about.
            I'm excited to share some of my favorite things with you. I obviously have more than three favorites of the topics of the website, but these are my absolute favorites.
        </p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a Computer Sciences major whose hobbies involve watching sports, watching movies, and reading books. Being a senior, I do not always have the most free time, but I am always doing one of the three when I do have some time. Feel free to click the links above at the top to get to know me and my favorite things.</p>
