            <dt >The Godfather by Mario Puzo</dt>
            <dd >
                <p>The Godfather may be the greatest book I have ever read. It is beautiful, gruesome, violent, but also a story of family and how family is always one thing you have and can't run away from.</p>

            <dt >1984 by George Orwell</dt>
            <dd >
                <p>1984 is a dystopian novel that remains eerily relevant today. Orwell's depiction of a totalitarian regime is chilling and thought-provoking.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt >The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald</dt>
            <dd >
                <p>The Great Gatsby is a timeless classic that explores themes of love, wealth, and the American Dream. Fitzgerald's prose is elegant and evocative.</p>
