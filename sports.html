        <h2>Top 3 Favorite Sports Teams</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Chicago Cubs (baseball)
                <p>Lovable Losers, Friendly Confines, That's Cub. I am a massive Cubs fan as I grew up 2 hours from Chicago. This team has given me the largest moments, and have broken my heart many times. I am proud to be a Cubs fan. It may not be easy, but nothing is.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Bryan Danielson (Pro Wrestling)
                <p>So this may not be a "team" but Bryan has been an individual who has made me feel my entire life. He is constantly an underdog due to his size and stature in a largely massive industry, but he never gave up. He has given me my quote that I live by. "Fight for your dreams, and your dreams will fight for you"</p>
            </li>
            <li><u>Wisconsin Badgers (American Football)</u>
                <p>The Badgers are my favorite college sports team because partly I went here. However, the community that the sports games has is amazing and I am so glad I was part of it for 4 years. On Wisconsin</p>
